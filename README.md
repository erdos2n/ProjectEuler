# Intro To Project Euler
Though I don't know the origins of Project Euler, I do love it and have been solving problems for a few years now.  Most of my code is not in this repo, since I've changed machines and just recently made my github account; however, I will try to redo as many of these as possible and push them to this repo.

# First Things First
* Do not peak at these if you haven't solved them!
* This is strictly for people to compare code or use if they're solving a problem involving certain functionalities relating to the problems
* Leave Feedback Please! I love to improve and all the feedback helps me to do so
